## §1 The obligation

```coq
(* theories-flocq/OverlayBridge.v — Admitted, registered deferred *)
Lemma extract_rings_valid :
  forall (op : BooleanOp) (A B : Geometry),
    valid_geometry A -> valid_geometry B ->
    fully_intersected (noded_segments A B) ->
    forall poly, In poly (extract op (noded_labeled_graph A B)) ->
      valid_polygon poly.
```

`valid_polygon` (`theories/Overlay.v:268`) is the conjunction of four OGC
§6 conditions on the outer ring and every hole:

| condition | `Overlay.v` | character |
|---|---|---|
| `ring_closed` | 235 | **combinatorial** (first = last vertex) |
| `ring_has_minimum_points` | 262 | **combinatorial** (`4 <= length`) |
| `ring_simple` | 244 | **analytic** (no proper self-intersection in ℝ²) |
| `hole_inside_outer` | 256 | **analytic** (a hole vertex is `point_in_ring` the outer) |

The current `extract` (`theories/OverlayGraph.v:653`) is the naive
S2 form: `List.filter` the edges by `edge_in_result op`, then `flat_map`
the survivors' endpoints into **one** ring. It does *not* satisfy
`valid_polygon` in general (the flattened endpoint list is neither closed
nor simple, and collapses all faces into a single "ring").

## §2 Why this has been deferred

Two independently thesis-shaped sub-problems (audit-phase3-milestone5.md
§4.3, §5.2):

1. **Assembly.** Turn the unordered surviving-edge set into *ordered closed
   walks* = the face boundaries of the planar subdivision. The standard
   tools (DCEL traversal, or cyclic-order-around-vertex Euler walks) are
   not in the stdlib, and `TopologyGraph` stores edges unordered with no
   face/incidence data. The recorded estimate is a 5–7 session DCEL rebuild.
2. **Geometric validity.** `ring_simple` and `hole_inside_outer` are
   point-set / Jordan-curve facts, entangled with the absent JCT toolkit
   (the same gap as H1 in `overlay_ng_correct_conditional`).

## §3 The lever: the hole-formation / dissolving heuristic

[`oracle/buffer_hole_count.py`](../oracle/buffer_hole_count.py) computes
the hole count of a region by **rasterising it on a grid, flood-filling the
complement, and counting bounded components** (components that do not touch
the grid border). Its self-test encodes the non-monotonic C-shape law:

```
  d:   0.0  0.3  1.0  2.0  3.0  5.0  8.0
holes:  0    0    1    1    0    0    0     (mouth seals -> hole; pocket fills -> gone)
```

i.e. a hole **forms** when a concavity's mouth seals and **dissolves** when
the pocket fills — `0 → 1 → 0`.

The decisive observation for this plan: **"bounded component of the
complement" is already a corpus predicate.**
`theories/PointInRingTangents.v` ships

```coq
ring_complement r q        := ~ ring_image r q          (* off the edge skeleton *)
connected_in_complement r p q := exists path, ... stays in ring_complement
in_bounded_component r p   := exists M>0, reachable q stay within radius M
geometric_interior_stdlib p r := ring_complement r p /\ in_bounded_component r p
```

`buffer_hole_count` is the **computable, grid-discretised oracle for
`in_bounded_component`**: each bounded flood-fill component is a witness
that its points are `in_bounded_component`, and "touches the border" is the
refutation (an unbounded path to infinity). So the heuristic is not a proof
device by itself, but it (a) gives a RocqRefRunner-style **differential
oracle** for any executable ring/face extractor, and (b) tells us the right
**invariant** to prove: *the assembled bounded faces are in bijection with
the heuristic's bounded complement components.*

## §4 Reframing `valid_polygon`: combinatorial core vs analytic shell

Split the obligation along the table in §1.

- **Combinatorial core (target of this plan, tractable):** `ring_closed`
  and `ring_has_minimum_points` hold *by construction* of a face walk, and
  hole nesting can be stated **combinatorially** as a parity/winding
  relation on faces rather than as point-set containment.
- **Analytic shell (kept deferred / named):** the upgrade of combinatorial
  nesting to the point-set `hole_inside_outer`. Remains JCT-adjacent.

The win: discharge the core unconditionally, and shrink the residual to a
*single* analytic hypothesis (the combinatorial→point-set nesting bridge)
that is strictly smaller than today's whole-of-`valid_polygon` gap — and
that the heuristic validates empirically.

> **`ring_simple` resolved (`theories/RingSimple.v`).** Contrary to the
> first cut above, `ring_simple` is **not** the hard analytic residual — it
> is **delivered by the noder**: `ring_simple_of_subset` proves a ring whose
> edges are drawn from a pairwise-non-properly-crossing (i.e. NODED)
> arrangement is `ring_simple` (instantiate with the snap-rounding noder's
> `fully_intersected` output). The *raw* offset is genuinely not simple
> (`not_ring_simple_bowtie`, a verified self-crossing counterexample — the
> hole-forming sealing mouth), which is precisely why the pipeline nodes
> before extracting. So the only remaining analytic residual is
> `hole_inside_outer`'s point-set half (= the H1/JCT gap of R3).

## §5 Proposed structure — half-edge faces + bounded-component invariant

A "DCEL-lite" that avoids re-doing M2's lemmas: keep `TopologyGraph` as is,
and define face walks as a *derived* notion.

1. **Half-edges.** For the surviving edge multiset, form directed
   half-edges (each undirected edge → two darts). `next` around a vertex =
   the cyclic successor by angle (`Azimuth.turn_sign` gives the comparison;
   no atan needed for a cyclic order via half-plane + cross-product sign).
2. **Face walk.** `face_of dart` = iterate `next ∘ twin`; a face is the
   orbit. **Targets (combinatorial, by induction on the orbit):**
   - `face_walk_closed`: every face orbit is a `ring_closed` ring.
   - `face_walk_min_points`: a bounded face orbit has `>= 4` vertices
     (a face of the fully-noded arrangement has no spurs).
3. **Bounded-face ↔ component invariant.** Prove the orbit-count /
   Euler relation `V - E + F = 1 + C` (C = connected components) so that
   **#bounded faces is determined combinatorially**, and connect a bounded
   face's interior points to `in_bounded_component` of its boundary ring.
   - `bounded_face_in_bounded_component`: a point strictly inside a bounded
     face orbit satisfies `in_bounded_component (face_ring) p`.
   This is the rung that the heuristic's flood-fill *counts*; the proof is
   a discrete reachability argument (no analytic JCT), mirroring the
   parity machinery already in `Overlay.ray_parity_odd` /
   `Overlay.point_in_ring`.
4. **`extract` re-defined** to emit `{ outer_ring := bounded-face-walk ;
   hole_rings := nested inner face-walks }`, with hole nesting read off the
   face-incidence tree (step 3), then `extract_rings_valid` becomes:
   composition of `face_walk_closed` + `face_walk_min_points` (core, Qed) +
   the residual analytic `ring_simple`/nesting bridge (named).

## §6 The tractable beachhead: specialise to **buffer**

The general overlay arrangement is arbitrary; the **buffer** offset curve
is not. For the buffer pipeline (`theories/BufferCorrectness.v`), the
output's hole topology is exactly the C-shape law the heuristic verifies:
holes are the pockets that *sealed but did not fill*. This is far more
structured than a generic two-geometry overlay.

**Proposal:** prove a buffer-specialised `extract_buffer_rings_valid`
first — it discharges the `H_valid` hypothesis of
`buffer_correct_conditional` for the buffer pipeline — using:
- the offset/join/cap geometry already Qed-closed
  (`BufferOffset`, `BufferJoin`, `BufferMiter`, `BufferBevel`,
  `BufferEndcap`): the raw curve's local structure is known exactly;
- the heuristic's hole law as the *specification* of which bounded faces
  survive (mouth-sealed-not-filled ⇒ hole), differentially tested;
- the §5 face machinery, but over the buffer curve's restricted topology
  (single input ring ⇒ at most the pockets as holes), where `ring_simple`
  of the offset is controlled by the parallel/limit results we already have
  (`offset_seg_parallel`, `miter_within_limit_iff`).

Closing the buffer case unblocks a real consumer (issue #65 / JTS#979)
without waiting on the fully-general DCEL + JCT.

## §7 Slice plan

> **R1+R2 landed (`theories/RingExtract.v`, axiom-free).** Refinement: a

> `face_orbit_finite` crux of §9) and extract its ring directly.
> `ring_of_chain` maps a chain to a `Ring`; `face_walk_closed` gives
> `ring_closed`; `face_walk_min_points` gives `ring_has_minimum_points` for
> ≥3 segments; `ring_edges_of_closed_chain` proves the ring's edges are
> **exactly** the chain (the faithful assembly↔ring bridge); `face_walk_core`
> bundles the three. This is the §6 buffer beachhead's combinatorial core.
> **Still open in R1:** ordering an *unordered* overlay edge set into chains
> (the dart/`next`/`turn_sign` assembly) — needed for the general (non-buffer)
> case. **Still the analytic shell (§4):** `ring_simple`, `hole_inside_outer`.
| R3 | `bounded_face_in_bounded_component` — discrete reachability ↔ `PointInRingTangents.in_bounded_component`. | **🟡 structure LANDED (Qed); geometric rung = named residual** `theories/BoundedComponent.v` | **med** (the heuristic's invariant) |

> **R3 split landed (`theories/BoundedComponent.v`, JCT-free).** The

> `connected_in_complement` is an equivalence relation on the complement
> (`_refl`/`_sym`/`_trans`, via explicit reparametrisations — the path

> `in_bounded_component` is a **component invariant** (`in_bounded_component_iff`

> `not_in_bounded_component_intro` refutes boundedness from unbounded

> **The geometric rung stays the named residual:** that a point strictly

> **not admitted** (no new registry debt).
| R4 | Euler / face-count `V-E+F` relation; #bounded faces = heuristic component count (oracle bridge). | Qed + differential test | med |
| R5 | Re-define `extract` (or `extract_buffer`) to emit face-walk rings + nesting tree. | defs | low |
| R6 | `extract_buffer_rings_valid` = R2 ⊕ `ring_simple`; discharge `BufferCorrectness.H_valid`. | **✅ LANDED (Qed), hole-free unconditional** `theories/ExtractBufferRings.v` | med |

| R7 | (stretch) general `extract_rings_valid`; or register the residual analytic shell as a *smaller* deferred entry. | **✅ analytic shell COMPLETED (Qed)** `theories/ExtractRingsShell.v` | high |

Each slice is independently `Qed`-able or ends in a documented, **smaller**
registered sub-deferred entry — never a silent stub. The combinatorial
core (R1–R2, R5) carries no analytic content and should close cleanly;
R3–R4 are where the heuristic earns its keep; R6 is the headline beachhead.

## §8 Oracle bridge (differential testing)

Extract the executable face/ring assembler (Coq → OCaml, RocqRefRunner
pattern) and test bounded-face counts against
`oracle/buffer_hole_count.py` on the C-shape family and the JTS#979
fixed-precision cases. Mismatch = a bug in the assembler *or* a too-coarse
grid (`res`); convergence under refinement is the acceptance gate. This
gives confidence in R5's definition *before* R6's proof, exactly as the
orientation / intersection lanes were de-risked.

## §9 Risks & decision points

- **Cyclic order without atan.** `next`-around-vertex needs a total cyclic
  order of darts. Use the half-plane split + `turn_sign` (cross-product
  sign) comparator — stays 3-axiom; avoid `Azimuth`/`atan2` to keep the
  combinatorial layer classic-clean. *Decision at R1.*
- **R3 is the crux.** If the discrete reachability ↔ `in_bounded_component`
  bridge resists (it is a small Jordan-flavoured argument), fall back to
  carrying it as the *named residual hypothesis* of R6 — still a strict
  shrink of today's gap, and the heuristic certifies it case-by-case.
- **`ring_simple` — RESOLVED (was thought analytic).** It is delivered by
  the noder, not by ℝ²-geometry: `RingSimple.ring_simple_of_subset` derives
  it from the noded arrangement's pairwise-non-crossing property
  (`fully_intersected`), and `not_ring_simple_bowtie` shows the raw offset
  is not simple (hence noding is required). No longer a residual.
- **Scope discipline.** Anything not `Qed` at the end of a slice is added
  to `docs/admitted-deferred-proofs.txt` as a *narrower* entry than
  `extract_rings_valid`, with its own section here.

## §11 2026-06-05: status — combinatorial core complete; frontier = the JCT residual

A re-audit of this lane (R1–R7 all landed on `main`) shows the slice plan is,
for practical purposes, **mined out down to a single analytic obstruction**.
What is Qed-closed and what remains:

**Qed-closed (combinatorial + noder-delivered `ring_simple`), JCT-free:**
- R1+R2 face-walk core — `theories/RingExtract.v` (`ring_of_chain`,
  `face_walk_closed`, `face_walk_min_points`, `ring_edges_of_closed_chain`,
  `face_walk_core`).
- R3 *component structure* — `theories/BoundedComponent.v`
  (`connected_in_complement` equivalence; `in_bounded_component` invariant;
  `not_in_bounded_component_intro`).
- `ring_simple` — RESOLVED via the noder (`RingSimple.ring_simple_of_subset`
  + `not_ring_simple_bowtie`); not an analytic residual.
- R6 hole-free `valid_polygon` + `H_valid` + end-to-end
  `buffer_correct_hole_free` / `buffer_correct_hole_free_split` —
  `theories/ExtractBufferRings.v`, `theories/BufferBridge.v`. **No JCT.**
- R7 analytic shell — `theories/ExtractRingsShell.v`
  (`hole_noded_chain_conditions`, `valid_polygon_noded_shell`,
  `H_valid_of_chain_extractor_holes`, `buffer_correct_with_holes`): the
  with-holes case is reduced to EXACTLY ONE analytic clause.

**The single remaining residual (thesis-scale, JCT-gated):** the point-set
`hole_inside_outer` nesting bridge = R3's geometric rung = "a point strictly
inside a bounded face orbit lies in `in_bounded_component` of its boundary
ring". This is **the same theorem** as:
- `overlay_ng_correct_conditional`'s H1 (`OverlayCorrectness.v`);
- `parity_characterises_interior_cont` (`theories/JCT.v:398`);
- the `point_in_ring` ↔ `geometric_interior_cont` equivalence.

**Strategic consequence.** All of the corpus's remaining *general* headlines —
general `extract_rings_valid`, with-holes buffer, OverlayNG correctness —
**converge on this one polygonal-Jordan-Curve fact.** The hole-free buffer
headline is already unconditional. The combinatorial assembly that is still
JCT-free but unlanded is narrow:
- **R1-open:** ordering an *unordered* overlay edge set into closed chains
  (the dart / `next`-via-`turn_sign` machinery; `face_orbit_finite` is the §9
  crux). Needed only for the *general* (non-buffer) case.
- **R4:** the Euler `V − E + F = 1 + C` face-count relation (oracle bridge).

**Cost/risk update.** The recorded "5–7 session DCEL" estimate is largely
*spent*: the combinatorial core landed and the hole-free buffer consumer is
discharged. Remaining headline value in this lane is **JCT-gated** (the same
3–5-month topology piece tracked for #65), with R1-open / R4 as the only
incremental, JCT-free combinatorial work left — valuable for the general case
but not reaching a headline on their own.

### §11.1 update (2026-06-05): rectangle special case fully discharged

`theories/RectangleSeparation.v` closes the rectangle case **unconditionally**:
`rect_confines` (the box-separation residual of §2b) is now proved for
strict-interior points, so `rect_parity_characterises_interior` gives
`point_in_ring p ↔ geometric_interior_cont p` for axis-aligned rectangle
interiors with **no residual hypothesis**. Method: a single continuous scalar
field `box_min` (>0 inside, =0 on the edge skeleton, <0 outside) reduces the 2-D
separation to Stdlib's 1-D intermediate value theorem (a complement path avoids
the boundary, so `box_min` along it never vanishes and cannot change sign).
Three-axiom footprint. The *general* polygonal JCT seam remains the open
frontier for arbitrary rings; the rectangle is now a complete worked instance.

### §11.2 update (2026-06-10): arbitrary-triangle parity — RED on the queued spec

Continuing the special-case ladder toward `hole_inside_outer` (rectangle →
right triangle → arbitrary triangle), the arbitrary-triangle **separation** half
is done (`GeneralTriangleSeparation.gtri_interior_is_geometric`), and the parity
half was *reduced* to the named hypothesis `GeneralTriangleParity.gtri_parity_spec`
(`point_in_ring p ↔ 0 < gtri p`). `theories/GeneralTriangleParityRED.v` shows
that spec is **FALSE as stated** (`gtri_parity_spec_false`): the witness `(0,2)`
on the left edge of triangle `(0,0),(4,0),(0,4)` has `point_in_ring` true (the
ray test is **half-open** — left edge included, just like
`RectangleJCT.point_in_ring_rect_iff`'s `x0 ≤ px`) while `gtri = 0`. So `↔ strict
interior` is the wrong RHS. Corrected next GREEN: the half-open characterisation,
or the single TRUE downstream-useful direction
`0 < gtri p ∧ ray_avoids_vertices p (gtri_ring …) ⇒ point_in_ring p`
(the `ray_avoids_vertices` guard is itself necessary — a strict-interior point at
a vertex's height makes the ray graze it, cf.
`theories/JCT_VertexGrazingCounterexample.v`), composing to the triangle
hole-nesting headline `hole_inside_outer_triangle` (the analogue of
`HoleInsideOuterRect.hole_inside_outer_rect`).

### §11.3 update (2026-06-10): arbitrary-triangle hole nesting — GREEN

`theories/GeneralTriangleHoleNesting.v` lands the corrected GREEN. The true,
useful parity direction `gtri_band_in_ring` proves: for an interior-side point
(`0 < gtri p`) whose height lies in one of the three **directed edge bands**
(`ay<py<by_ ∨ by_<py<cy ∨ cy<py<ay`), `point_in_ring p (gtri_ring …)` holds.
Mechanism: with all three inward slacks positive, `edge_cross_sign` collapses
each edge's ray-crossing to exactly its directed band (the opposite slack-sign
disjunct is dead), and the bands are pairwise disjoint, so a point in one band
crosses *exactly one* edge → odd parity. The directed band is the triangle
counterpart of the rectangle's explicit `y0 < py < y1`. Composing with
`In p hole` gives `hole_inside_outer_triangle`, the arbitrary-triangle analogue
of `HoleInsideOuterRect.hole_inside_outer_rect` — an **unconditional** discharge
of `hole_inside_outer` for a triangular outer ring, with no JCT hypothesis. So
the special-case ladder now reads rectangle → right triangle → **arbitrary
triangle (done)** → general convex (the `convex_separation` engine awaits a
convex-n-gon consumer; the half-plane↔edge skeleton bridge is the next frontier).

### §11.4 update (2026-06-10): the band hypothesis discharged — guarded coverage + H1-seam iff

`theories/GeneralTriangleJCT.v` removes §11.3's explicit band hypothesis:
`gtri_ray_coverage` proves that `0 < gtri p` **plus the `ray_avoids_vertices`
guard** already places `py p` in one of the three directed bands, so
`gtri_interior_in_ring` needs interior positivity and genericity only.
Coverage is a 27-branch trichotomy over `py p` vs the three vertex heights:
the strict branches land in a band or die on the barycentric height identity
`gsB·(ay−py) + gsC·(by_−py) + gsA·(cy−py) = 0` (a `ring` consequence of
`g_sum`/`g_baryy`); in the equality (grazing) branches the guard forces the
grazed vertex strictly **west**, which factors the two adjacent slacks as
(height difference)·(vertex x − px) and orients the remaining heights — every
guard-consistent equality branch is one a band already covers, the rest are
`nra` contradictions. The guard is necessary at exactly the middle-vertex
height (cf. `JCT_VertexGrazingCounterexample.v`). No orientation hypothesis:
`0 < gtri p` forces `0 < gdbl` via `g_sum`.

Headlines: `general_triangle_parity_characterises_interior` (`point_in_ring ↔
geometric_interior_cont` for guarded strict-interior points — the **third fully
Qed-closed family** after the rectangle and right triangle on the H1 parity
seam) and `hole_inside_outer_triangle_guarded` (+ `_generic`: three height
disequalities discharge the guard) — hole nesting with no band bookkeeping,
closing the "assembly TODO" of Stage D (triangle) in
`docs/hole-inside-outer-plan.md`. Three-axiom; no `Admitted`.

### §11.5 update (2026-06-10): first with-holes valid_polygon (unconditional)

`theories/TriangleValidPolygon.v` composes §11.3's `hole_inside_outer_triangle`
into a concrete **`Overlay.valid_polygon` with a hole**, discharged with NO
Jordan hypothesis: `triangle_with_hole_valid` (outer triangle `(0,0),(6,0),(0,6)`,
hole `(1,1),(3,1),(1,3)`). All four OGC conditions hold for outer and hole; the
analytic `hole_inside_outer` clause — the residual that gated the with-holes
case of `extract_rings_valid` — is now unconditional for triangular outers. The
reusable ingredient `gtri_ring_simple` (a non-degenerate triangle ring is simple,
the `gtri_ring` analogue of `KakeyaOverlay.perron_tri_ring_simple`) supplies the
`ring_simple` conjunct for both rings. This is the first concrete `valid_polygon`
*with a hole* in the corpus whose analytic clause carries no named seam.

### §11.5b update (2026-06-14): the diamond — fourth total family, first convex assembly user

The H1 parity seam has since been carried to the corrected **off-ring** form
`parity_characterises_interior_cont_offring` (interior *and* exterior, off the
skeleton), made **total** (unconditional) for the rectangle
(`RectangleOffringSeam.v`), the general triangle (`GeneralTriangleOffringSeam.v`),
and the right triangle (`ConvexOffringSeam.v`); the generic convex assembly
`ConvexOffringSeam.convex_parity_seam_offring_of` reduces it for any
half-plane-presented ring to four presentation facts + two guarded-parity facts.

`theories/DiamondOffringSeam.v` lands the **fourth total family** —
`diamond_parity_seam_offring : forall p, parity_characterises_interior_cont_offring
p diamond_ring` — the **first convex four-gon** and the **first instantiation of
`convex_parity_seam_offring_of`**. The diamond `(0,-2),(2,0),(0,2),(-2,0)`
(the region `|x|+|y| <= 2`) is presented by its four edge half-planes
`diamond_hps`; the presentation obligations (zero-set of `conv_min` on the
skeleton, vertices in all half-planes, non-degeneracy, bounded positive region)
are mechanical, and the two guarded-parity obligations go through the already-Qed
monotone-chain split (`MonotoneChainParity.bimonotone_split_parity` over
`ConvexChainSplit.diamond_bimonotone`) + `GeneralTriangleParity.edge_cross_sign`:
a strict-interior point's rightward ray crosses the right (increasing) chain
exactly once, an exterior point's ray crosses the two chains both-or-neither.
`diamond_point_in_ring_iff_geometric` is the off-ring biconditional corollary;
three-axiom, no `Admitted`. A **general** convex *n*-gon remains open only on the
"split-from-convexity" derivation (`ConvexChainSplit.interior_hits_one_chain` /
`bimonotone_split` from `vertices_in_halfplane`) — isolated, not yet built.

### §11.5c update (2026-06-14): rung 3.5 — the bimonotone split, now general

`theories/MonotoneChainConstruction.v` removes the per-family hand-construction
of `bimonotone_split`. Until now every split was built by hand: the diamond
exhibits explicit `diamond_inc` / `diamond_dec` edge lists and proves
`bimonotone_split diamond_ring diamond_inc diamond_dec` by `reflexivity` over the
edge concatenation plus four `lra` height checks. The new file proves the split
**generically** from a purely combinatorial hypothesis on the *vertex list*:

```
Theorem bimonotone_split_unimodal :
  forall (up down : list Point) (apex : Point),
    y_strict_incr (up ++ [apex]) ->        (* heights rise strictly to the apex *)
    y_strict_decr (apex :: down) ->        (* then fall strictly back down      *)
    bimonotone_split (up ++ apex :: down)
                     (ring_edges (up ++ [apex]))
                     (ring_edges (apex :: down)).
```

The proof has three combinatorial pieces, all `Qed`: `ring_edges_app_shared`
(the skeleton of `l1 ++ m :: l2` is the skeleton of the closed prefix `l1 ++ [m]`
followed by the skeleton of the suffix `m :: l2`, joined at the shared vertex
`m`); and `chain_increasing_of_y_strict_incr` /
`chain_decreasing_of_y_strict_decr` (a strictly monotone vertex run yields a
monotone chain — connectivity `snd e = fst e2` is automatic because consecutive
`ring_edges` share their middle vertex). **Convexity is not used**: this isolates
exactly the combinatorial content of the split. The geometric implication
(convex `vertices_in_halfplane` ⟹ the vertex order is y-unimodal) and the dual
`interior_hits_one_chain` remain the open residual for a fully general *n*-gon.

The split obligation is thereby reduced to an **arithmetic** per-family check:
`diamond_bimonotone_via_unimodal` re-derives the diamond split in one
`apply` + two `cbn`/`lra` calls, and `hexagon_bimonotone` exhibits the split of a
genuinely convex CCW **hexagon** `(0,-3),(3,-1),(4,2),(1,3),(-2,1),(-3,-2)` with
no extra machinery — only the height comparisons change. Three-axiom, no
`Admitted`. This is the reusable substrate that makes the split of any future
convex family a one-liner; the remaining frontier is `interior_hits_one_chain`.

### §11.5d update (2026-06-15): rung 4 — the edge-halfplane algebraic bridge, `interior_hits_one_chain` closed

`theories/MonotoneChainCoverage.v` closes the `interior_hits_one_chain` residual for
any convex polygon family whose CCW inward half-planes are supplied in `hps`.

The **key algebraic identity** (`hp_slack_edge_inward_cross_product`, `ring` proof):

```
hp_slack (edge_inward_hp (mkPoint vx vy, mkPoint wx wy)) q
  = (wx - vx) * (py q - vy) - (wy - vy) * (px q - vx)
```

This is exactly the signed cross-product that `GeneralTriangleParity.edge_cross_sign`
uses to characterise `edge_crosses_ray`, yielding two algebraic bridge lemmas:

- `edge_up_crosses_iff_hp`: for an inc edge (vy < wy),
  `edge_crosses_ray q e ↔ (vy < py q < wy) ∧ (hp_slack (edge_inward_hp e) q > 0)`.
- `edge_dn_crosses_iff_hp`: for a dec edge (wy < vy),
  `edge_crosses_ray q e ↔ (wy < py q < vy) ∧ (hp_slack (edge_inward_hp e) q < 0)`.

A strictly-interior point has `hp_slack > 0` for ALL half-planes in `hps`
(`conv_min_pos_iff`), so:

- inc chain edges that straddle the ray height ARE crossed;
- dec chain edges that straddle are NOT crossed (hp_slack > 0 contradicts < 0).

The height-band coverage lemma `chain_increasing_straddles_y` (induction over
the monotone vertex list) guarantees that some inc chain edge straddles the query
height whenever `py bottom < py q < py apex`. Vertex-height avoidance (`py v ≠ py q`
for all vertices `v`) is derived from `ray_avoids_vertices` via the x-bound:
`hp_slack > 0` at height `wy` forces `px q < wx`, while `ray_avoids_vertices`
forbids `px q ≤ px v` at matching heights — a contradiction.

The **headline theorem** (`interior_hits_one_chain_of_edge_hps`) assembles these
pieces to deliver `chain_crossed q inc ∧ ¬ chain_crossed q dec` for any y-unimodal
ring under the edge-hp and ray-avoidance guards. Concrete validations:
`diamond_interior_chain_hit` and `hexagon_interior_chain_hit` discharge all
premises by `cbn`/`lra`. Three-axiom, no `Admitted`.

The convexity ⟹ y-unimodal vertex-order implication remains the only open residual
for a fully general convex *n*-gon.

### §11.5e update (2026-06-15): rung 5 — the convex hexagon, the fifth total family (n > 4)

`theories/HexagonOffringSeam.v` lands the CCW hexagon
`(0,-3),(3,-1),(4,2),(1,3),(-2,1),(-3,-2)` as the **fifth total off-ring JCT
family** and the **first convex polygon with more than four edges**. It is the
first family to consume rung 4, and it shows the rung-1…5 stack scales past four
edges with only an arithmetic per-family check.

The hexagon is presented by its six edge inward half-planes
(`MonotoneChainCoverage.hexagon_edge_hps`) and discharges the six obligations of
`ConvexOffringSeam.convex_parity_seam_offring_of`:

- **Presentation (1-4).** Zero-set on skeleton (six `Exists` cases, each giving
  the on-edge parameter `t` from the vanishing slack), vertices-in-half-planes,
  non-degeneracy, and a bounded positive region: the six slacks pin the point
  into the box `[-3,4] × [-3,3]` (linear combinations, `lra`), inside radius 5.
- **Interior-odd (5).** Now a near one-liner: from `0 < conv_min` the six slacks
  give the y-span `-3 < py q < 3` by `lra`, then rung 4's
  `hexagon_interior_chain_hit` yields "crosses the increasing chain once, misses
  the decreasing one", and `bimonotone_split_parity` turns that XOR into
  `point_in_ring`.
- **Exterior-even (6).** A six-edge per-band case analysis. From the bimonotone
  split a point with odd parity crosses exactly one chain; for each crossed chain
  edge its y-band fixes the unique straddling opposite-chain edge, and either all
  six slacks are forced nonnegative (so `0 ≤ conv_min`, contradicting
  `conv_min < 0`) or the two opposite straddling slacks are geometrically
  incompatible (`lra`). The four span-interior vertex heights (`y = -2, -1, 1, 2`)
  are excluded using `ray_avoids_vertices`, exactly as the diamond used the guard
  at `y = 0`.

Per-edge crossing is captured by six `gK_cross_iff` lemmas (`edge_cross_sign` +
`lra`), each in clean `(y-band, slack-sign)` form. Three-axiom, no `Admitted`.
The remaining open residual for a fully general convex *n*-gon is unchanged: the
convexity ⟹ y-unimodal vertex-order implication, plus a general (rather than
per-family) exterior-even — the latter needs the convex "between the two boundary
edges ⟹ inside" fact, which for a concrete polygon is a finite `lra`/`nra`
consequence of the explicit half-plane coefficients (as exercised here) but is
the genuine convex content in the general case.

### §11.5f update (2026-06-15): the einstein's concave pocket — the first concave point-in-polygon classification

Every off-ring family so far (rectangle, the two triangles, diamond, hexagon) is
**convex** and rides the half-plane `conv_min` separation engine. The "hat"
aperiodic einstein monotile (`HatMonotile.hat_ring`, a 13-gon with exact `sqrt 3`
hex-lattice coordinates) is the corpus's only **concave** shape; it is already
mechanized as closed (`hat_ring_closed`), simple (`HatValidPolygon.hat_ring_simple`,
the ~78-pair `nra` bash), of minimum points, genuinely non-convex
(`hat_non_convex`: a reflex turn `cross<0` at `(3,1)` and a convex turn at `(2,0)`),
and as an interior ray-parity witness (`HatMonotileInterior.hat_point_in_ring`: the
top-bump point `(17/4, 5√3/4)` has crossing-number 1 = odd = inside).

`theories/HatMonotileExterior.v` adds the dual — and the distinctly concave —
witness. The hat's bottom boundary has a **reflex notch**: the hex edges
`(2,0)→(3,1)→(4,0)` map to the plane spike `(2,0)→(3.5,√3/2)→(4,0)` whose apex
`(3,1)` is reflex. The test point `(7/2, √3/4)` sits inside that spike triangle —
**inside the convex hull, but in the notch, hence exterior to the tile**. At height
`√3/4 ∈ (0, √3/2)` the rightward ray meets exactly two edges to its right (the
down-edge `(3,1)→(4,0)` and the up-edge `(6,0)→(7,1)`); crossing-number **2** = even
⇒ `hat_pocket_not_in_ring : ~ point_in_ring (7/2, √3/4) hat_ring`. No convex polygon
can present a hull-interior exterior point, so this is the first genuinely concave
point-in-polygon classification in the corpus. `hat_parity_classification` bundles
it with `hat_point_in_ring` into the einstein's first in/out pair.

Mechanics mirror the interior witness: the parity walk uses the mutually-inductive
`ray_parity_even`/`ray_parity_odd` constructors (`rpe_*`/`rpo_*`), toggling at the two
crossed edges and ending **even**, then `ray_parity_even_not_odd` (a local
structural-induction lemma, as in `JCT_Counterexample.v`) excludes membership.
Each per-edge crossing fact is `edge_cross_sign` + `nra`; choosing `py = √3/4` (a
rational multiple of `√3`) keeps every height/slack comparison homogeneous in `√3`,
so `nra` closes from `0 < √3` alone — no numeric `√3` bound needed. This is the
convexity-INDEPENDENT ray-parity (crossing-number) membership, **not** the JCT
topological-interior equivalence (the hat is out of reach of the convex separation
engine; that equivalence remains the polygonal-JCT residual). Three-axiom, no
`Admitted`.

### §11.5g update (2026-06-15): the Spectre — the second concave family

`theories/SpectreConcaveFamily.v` brings the **Spectre** aperiodic monotile to
parity with the hat as the corpus's **second fully-mechanized concave family** (the
hat is the first; §11.5f). The Spectre already existed as `SpectreExample.spectre_ring`
— a non-convex 14-gon under the **rational** hex embedding `hpt x y = (x + y/2, y)`
(a vertical scale of the equilateral metric, parity-preserving) — with `ring_closed`,
`min_points`, and an interior ray-parity witness `spectre_point_in_ring` at `(5, 1/2)`
(odd), but deliberately deferred `ring_simple` and supplied no exterior witness.

This file closes both:

- **`spectre_ring_simple`** — the deferred ~70 edge-pair non-self-intersection bash.
  Same flat `destruct`/`first[…|nra]` shape as `HatValidPolygon.hat_ring_simple`, but
  all coordinates are rational, so plain `nra` discharges every off-diagonal pair with
  no `sqrt 3` facts. Feeds **`valid_polygon_spectre`** via
  `FacePolygonHoles.polygon_valid_of_rings`.
- **`spectre_non_convex`** — concavity certificate via `Orientation.cross`: a reflex
  turn (`cross<0`) at the spike apex `(3,1)` and a convex turn (`cross>0`) at `(2,0)`.
- **`spectre_pocket_not_in_ring`** — the concave-pocket exterior witness. The point
  `(7/2, 1/2)` sits in the bottom reflex notch (the spike `(2,0)→(3.5,1)→(4,0)`, inside
  the convex hull but outside the tile). At height `1/2 ∈ (0,1)` the rightward ray meets
  exactly the down-edge `(3.5,1)→(4,0)` and the up-edge `(6,0)→(7.5,1)`; crossing-number
  **2** = even ⇒ `~ point_in_ring`. The parity walk uses the `rpe_*`/`rpo_*` constructors
  and a local `ray_parity_even_not_odd`, with each per-edge fact closed by `lra`.
  **`spectre_parity_classification`** bundles it with the interior witness into the
  Spectre's first in/out pair.

As with the hat's `hat_pocket_not_in_ring`, a hull-interior exterior point is a
configuration no convex polygon can present; this exercises the convexity-INDEPENDENT
ray-parity layer, **not** the JCT topological-interior equivalence (out of reach of the
convex separation engine for a non-convex ring). Three-axiom, no `Admitted`.

### §11.5h update (2026-06-15): the y-modulator (first step) — convexity is the all-left-turns form

`theories/ConvexYUnimodal.v` opens the campaign's last general-convex frontier: the
geometric implication "convexity ⟹ the vertex order is y-unimodal", which is what a
*general* convex *n*-gon needs to feed rung 3.5 (`bimonotone_split_unimodal`) and
hence rung 4 (`interior_hits_one_chain_of_edge_hps`) without a hand-built split.

The first stones, all `Qed`:

- **The convexity ⟺ orientation bridge.** `hp_slack (edge_inward_hp (a,b)) c = cross a b c`
  exactly (`hp_slack_edge_inward_is_cross`, from the rung-4 cross-product identity).
  Hence `vertices_in_halfplane` — every vertex in every edge's inward half-plane — is
  literally "every vertex is left-of-or-on every directed edge", i.e. all boundary turns
  are CCW (`convex_left_turns`: `0 <= cross a b c` for every edge `(a,b)` and vertex `c`).
  The hypothesis is GLOBAL (all vertices vs. all edges), which correctly rules out the
  pentagram — a star has all *local* left-turns yet a vertex outside a non-adjacent
  edge's half-plane, and is not y-unimodal. Using local turn-signs alone would be unsound.
- **The structural target + wiring.** `y_unimodal_decomposition r` names the goal
  (`r = up ++ apex :: down` with `y_strict_incr (up ++ [apex])` and
  `y_strict_decr (apex :: down)`); `y_unimodal_bimonotone` discharges `bimonotone_split`
  from it via rung 3.5.
- **Extremum infra.** `exists_max_y_vertex` / `exists_min_y_vertex` (a nonempty ring has
  maximal-/minimal-height vertices) — the apex/bottom locators a closing rung needs.
- **Validation.** `diamond_y_unimodal` / `hexagon_y_unimodal` show both families are
  y-unimodal directly (their CCW order already starts at the bottom vertex), recovering
  their bimonotone splits through the modulator. Note the diamond is y-unimodal despite
  the `(2,0)`/`(-2,0)` height tie — the tie lands on OPPOSITE chains, so each chain is
  individually strict; the eventual residual's general-position guard is therefore "no two
  adjacent-on-a-chain vertices share y", not full y-injectivity.

The remaining residual — the implication *`convex_left_turns`-form (global) ⟹
`y_unimodal_decomposition`* for a general convex ring under the right general-position
guard — is the genuine convex content (it needs the canonical-start rotation plus the
"a convex region meets each horizontal line in an interval ⟹ a single ascending and a
single descending run" argument). It is isolated here, to be closed by a follow-up rung.
Three-axiom, no `Admitted`.

### §11.5i update (2026-06-15): the y-modulator (crossing bound) — inside iff one crossing

`theories/ConvexRayCrossing.v` proves the crossing bound a bimonotone split buys —
the crisp discrete Jordan characterisation for the convex case, all `Qed`:

- **Each monotone chain is crossed at most once** (count form): `inc_cross_count_le_one`
  / `dec_cross_count_le_one`. From `inc_chain_le_one_cross` / `dec_chain_le_one_cross`
  (two crossing edges of a monotone chain are equal) plus the chain's strict y-ordering
  (`chain_increasing_above` / `chain_decreasing_below`), a head crossing forces zero tail
  crossings, by induction on the chain.
- **The whole ring is crossed at most twice** (`convex_ray_crosses_le_two`): for a
  `bimonotone_split r inc dec`, `cross_count p (ring_edges r) = cross_count p inc +
  cross_count p dec <= 1 + 1` (via `cross_count_app`).
- **HEADLINE** (`convex_in_ring_iff_one_crossing`): combine the `<= 2` bound with ray
  parity (`ray_parity_count`: `point_in_ring p r` ⟺ `Nat.odd (cross_count p (ring_edges r))
  = true`) — odd and `<= 2` pins the count to exactly `1`. So for a convex / y-unimodal
  ring, `point_in_ring p r ↔ cross_count p (ring_edges r) = 1`. Where the bare parity seam
  fixes only the crossing *parity*, convexity fixes the exact *count*.

Validated on the diamond and hexagon (both already carry a `bimonotone_split`). This takes
the split as hypothesis — supplied generally by the y-modulator (`ConvexYUnimodal.v`) once
its residual (convexity ⟹ y-unimodal vertex order) is closed, and concretely by every
family today. Three-axiom, no `Admitted`.

### §11.6 update (2026-06-11): the extract rewire — `extract_faces` lands

`theories/ExtractFaces.v` closes §11's "R1-open" item (the §5-step-4
"`extract` re-defined"): the DCEL face machinery is now **wired to the
pipeline**. `extract_faces op g` filters `tg_edges g` by `edge_in_result op`
(exactly `OverlayGraph.extract`'s filter) and emits one hole-free face polygon
per surviving dart by walking `fstep` orbits — face walks instead of the
refuted flatten. The period of each orbit is **computed** (`face_period`, a
bounded first-return search justified by `orbit_returns_bounded` — the
pigeonhole bound `OrbitCycle` proves internally but does not export). The
headline `extract_faces_valid` has the obligation shape of the registered
deferred `extract_rings_valid` itself — `forall poly, In poly (extract_faces
op g) -> valid_polygon poly` — hole-free, **no JCT residual**, under the
noder's three structural hypotheses (per-vertex `fan_ok`,
`pairwise_no_proper_cross`, `no_short_faces`); and
`extract_faces_label_fidelity` proves the emitted rings trace ONLY op-kept
edges. Remaining in this lane: with-holes emission (nesting tree + the §4
analytic residual), discharging the three hypotheses from
`fully_intersected`'s concrete output, and R4. See
[`docs/extract-faces.md`](extract-faces.md).
